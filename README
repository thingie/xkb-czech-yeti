Slightly modified XKB layout, originally from David Necas <yeti@physics.muni.cz>
(see symbols/yeti).

Basically, it's an us layout with a second group with some czech accents, switched
by left shift + right shift. It also adds few symbols like „proper czech quotation
marks“.

You have to manually load it with

setxkbmap -compat yeti -symbols yeti

Until we all live in the bright Wayland wonderland future, of course.
